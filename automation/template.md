There are too many snowflake accounts to keep up with them all. 

This list updates once a day, feel free to [add any missing playlists](#add-a-playlist). Tap a column's header to sort by that field.

## Add a playlist

To add a playlist, edit [`channels.txt`](https://github.com/JakeSteam/osrs-ironmen/blob/main/automation/channels.txt) to include the playlist ID and name:
* Playlist ID can be retrieved from the playlist's URL (everything after `?list=`).
* Playlist name is not used, except to make the file more readable.

Alternatively, drop an email to [osrs@jakelee.co.uk](mailto:osrs@jakelee.co.uk) and it'll get added.
