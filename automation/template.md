There are too many goddamn snowflake accounts, here's a list of all that have YouTube series. At least, those with more than 2 progress videos!

This list updates once a day, feel free to [add any missing playlists](#add-a-playlist). Tap a column's header to sort by that field.

Jump to:
* [Misc restrictions](#misc-restrictions)
* [Item-based restrictions](#item-based-restrictions)
* [Skill-based restrictions](#skill-based-restrictions)
* [Location-based restrictions](#location-based-restrictions)
* [World-based restrictions](#world-based-restrictions)

## Add a playlist

To add a playlist, edit [`channels.txt`](https://github.com/JakeSteam/osrs-ironmen/blob/main/automation/playlists.txt) to include the playlist ID and name:
* Playlist ID can be retrieved from the playlist's URL (everything after `?list=`).
* Playlist name is used for the first column, shorter is better.

Alternatively, drop an email to [osrs@jakelee.co.uk](mailto:osrs@jakelee.co.uk) and it'll get added.

### Notes

[^max-videos]: Note that only 50 playlist videos can be fetched at once via YouTube's API, and pagination is not currently implemented.
